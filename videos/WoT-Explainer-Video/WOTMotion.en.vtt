00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
A Fruit farmer is looking for ways 
to increase productivity

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.000
while maintaining excellent 
product quality.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.000
To monitor and control 
growing conditions,

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
the farmer plans to install humidity and temperature sensors, 
and a sprinkler system.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Weather forecast data 
from an online web service

6
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
would also be useful in order 
to predict watering requirements.

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
The farmer decides to engage 
an IT consultant.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
They would like to use the developer of their web presence 
to realize an IoT solution.

9
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.000
The developers at Web Agency 
like the new challenge

10
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.000
and are willing to broaden 
their IoT knowledge.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.000
They are experts in both web frontend and 
backend technologies using Node JS.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.000
However, they are worried about 
the interoperability problems

13
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.000
that they experienced 
in a previous IoT project.

14
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
After searching online 
for a solution,

15
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.000
the developers find information 
on the Web of Things, WoT

16
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.000
WoT is a W3C standard that enables Web developers 
to become IoT developers

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
using the tools 
and frameworks they love. 

18
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.000
WoT can be applied 
to many different IoT domains,

19
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.000
such as Manufacturing 
or Building Automation,

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.000
but is also applicable to our farmer's problem 
in the Agriculture domain.

21
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
The developers are happy 
to find a bunch

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
of WoT tutorials on thingweb.io, 
YouTube, and GitHub.

23
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.000
With node-wot, various 
protocol bindings

24
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.000
like HTTP, MQTT, CoAP, 
and Modbus,

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.000
and a browser bundle, the developers easily create 
a full stack IoT solution.

26
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.000
Their solution connects 
all the devices

27
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.000
and includes a great user interface 
built with web technology.

28
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.000
Instead of creating a one-off, 
proprietary solution,

29
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.000
the developers use the WoT methodology 
to create IoT building blocks.

30
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.000
These building blocks extend 
their existing Web technologies portfolio.

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000
Thing Descriptions, 
WoT application templates,

32
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.000
and IoT semantics are now in the same portfolio 
of reusable modules

33
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000
as HTML pages, JavaScript packages, 
or CSS from former web projects.

34
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
The main element 
of the WoT methodology

35
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.000
is the Thing Description, 
also known as a Tee-Dee.

36
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.000
The TD is comparable 
to an index.html for Things. 

37
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
Various questions can be answered
 by the information in the TD

38
00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.000
TD like Identification, Data organization, Access, Units,
Types, Interactions, Security or Relationships.

39
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
Classical IoT projects 
usually cause high costs,

40
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.000
especially due 
to the high integration effort

41
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.000
of the different data models 
and protocols of the devices or services.

42
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.000
In contrast, with WoT the developers create 
the IoT solution in just a few sprints

43
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.000
by combining WoT TDs, protocol bindings, 
and scripting with their web expertise. 

44
00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.000
This leads to reduction in development 
and maintenance costs,

45
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.000
saving time 
and money.

46
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.000
The developers gain confidence 
in IoT

47
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.000
and from now on consider themselves experts 
in both Web and IoT technologies.

48
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.000
Based on WoT the farmer's IoT project 
could be easy realized. 

49
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.000
Now the developers are ready to tackle 
their next IoT challenge.

50
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:41.000
And yes, WoT is THE methodology 
they will use!
