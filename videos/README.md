# Videos 
Some raw video material,
including short segments of "plugfest" demos that we can edit together into a "demo" video for a breakout session,
or a "WoT introduction" video.

These do not need to be final.  Please create an MD file with the same basename as the video explaining it.
Videos should be suitable for public distribution e.g. all rights and releases should have been obtained.
Please do not, for instance, use music you have not obtained the rights to.

Links to videos stored elsewhere are appropriate, especially for large video files.

Ideally final videos should have a voice-over and corresponding text overlay.
Ege's tutorial is a good example of the style that should be used, although we probably should add consistent
title and closing screens (e.g. following the Powerpoint template).
