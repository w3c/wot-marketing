# Contributing to the WoT Marketing Task Force

This repository is mainly used for the development of the WoT Page at https://www.w3.org/WoT/. In addition to that, you can find outreach and marketing material.
As this repository is managed by the [WoT Interest Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot/), significant contributions are limited to WoT IG members.
In order to make changes to the web page, please look at the instructions in [docs](./docs) folder.
