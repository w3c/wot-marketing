<h2>W3C WoT – Discovery Task Force</h2>
    <p>The WoT Discovery task force is responsible for

    while supporting security and privacy.

        <h4>WoT Discovery</h4>
            <p>The WoT Discovery specfication defines a mechanism to provide
            access to WoT Thing Descriptions in both local and global contexts.
            It uses a two-phase approach to take advantage of existing discovery
            mechanisms for "first contact" but provides for authenticated web services
            to actually provide metadata in order to support security and privacy goals.
            WoT Thing Descriptions can be retreived from services running either on
            a Thing itself, supporting self-describing objects, or from a directory
            service that provides a searchable database of WoT Thing Descriptions.
