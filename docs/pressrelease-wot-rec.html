    <p id="desc"><a href="/">https://www.w3.org/</a> &#8212; DD Month
    2020 &#8212; The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced today
    that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">Web of
    Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
    and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">Web of Things (WoT) Thing
    Description</a> (TD) are now official W3C Recommendations.
    These complement
    existing standardized web technologies to enable easy
    integration across Internet of Things platforms and
    applications. 
    </p>
    <p>@@quote?</p>
    <p>The diversity of technologies used in Internet of Things (IoT), such as protocols and data models, typically causes high integration and maintenance 
	    costs in IoT projects.
  The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> activities is 
	    to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by defining a Web-based abstraction layer for, e.g., 
	    existing platforms, devices, gateways and services. By complementing existing standards, it reduces risk for 
	    investors and customers as well as enabling rapid growth of open markets for devices and services.</p>
  <p>
  Two baseline specifications have been developed by the Web of Things Working Group 
  during the last two years. They define an abstract architecture and several building blocks 
  and a common data format for describing devices and services: 
  <ul>
     <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a> describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.</li> 
     <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> provides a common human- and machine-readable data format for describing Thing's metadata and its capabilities including used data model, protocol and security setup.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
The WoT Thing Description is to the Internet of Things what index.html is to a website: it can be considered as the entry point of a physical or virtual Thing/device. The WoT building blocks increase interoperability for IoT applications and reduce integration efforts and costs. 
</p>

<p>
During the course of the Web of Things standardization activities, several other informative documents were also created, such as WoT Scripting API, WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines, and WoT Binding Templates.
	</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>
        The goal of the WoT is to enhance interoperability and counter fragmentation in IoT 
        using a cross-ecosystem approach.
        In particular, rather than prescribing behavior, interfaces, or data models, the
        WoT Thing Description provide a common way for descriptive information (metadata) about 
        these key aspects of IoT devices and services to be communicated with.
        The ability to share service metadata is a key enabler
        of an open market for IoT devices and services.
    </p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>

    <p>

      The two WoT documents that have recently become W3C Recommendations 
      define the WoT Architecture and the WoT Thing Description (TD).
      The WoT Architecture document describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.
      Whereas the WoT Thing Description provides a standard way for the metadata 
      of a Thing to be provided, including descriptions of its network API, semantics, and data models.
      The WoT Working Group and Interest Group have also published some
      related informative documents: 
      the WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines, 
      the WoT Scripting API, and the WoT Binding Templates.
      The WoT Binding Templates describe how WoT Thing Descriptions can be used 
      with specific concrete protocols.
      The WoT Scripting API provides a common way to access and process 
      WoT Thing Descriptions from within applications as well as to interact with the Things.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>

    <p>
      The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains, including
      Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health applications.
      In general, the use of W3C WoT standards can simplify the development of IoT systems that 
      combine devices from multiple vendors and ecosystems.
      For different kinds of users, the W3C WoT standards provide the following specific benefits:
      <dl>
	      <dt>Developers</dt>
	      <dd>WoT simplifies software development and service integration.</dd>
	      <dt>Device vendors</dt>
	      <dd>WoT provides a mechanism to provide and document open APIs.</dd>
	      <dt>Cloud platform and application vendors</dt> 
	      <dd>WoT provides opportunities to provide support services and applications.</dd>
        <dt>System integrators</dt>
		<dd>WoT provides a way to build systems that 
            integrate devices across vendors and ecosystems.</dd>
		<dt>Governments and regulatory agencies building open IoT platforms</dt>
		<dd>WoT
            provides an open standard for communicating available services.</dd>
      </dl>
      Many of these use cases and applications were discussed at length
      in the recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/cfp.html">WoT Workshop</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>What's Next?</h3>

    <p>
    The WoT WG has recently renewed its charter and will be addressing a number of 
    new enhancements, including discovery, onboarding, and  
    profile mechanism.
    See the new <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/01/wot-wg-charter.html">WoT WG Charter</a>

    <h2>About the World Wide Web Consortium</h2>

    <p>The mission of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is to lead
    the Web to its full potential by creating technical standards and
    guidelines to ensure that the Web remains open, accessible, and
    interoperable for everyone around the globe. W3C well-known
    standards HTML and CSS are the foundational technologies upon
    which websites are built. W3C works on ensuring that all
    foundational Web technologies meet the needs of civil society, in
    areas such as accessibility, internationalization, security, and
    privacy. W3C also provides the standards that undergird the
    infrastructure for modern businesses leveraging the Web, in areas
    such as entertainment, communications, digital publishing, and
    financial services. That work is created in the open, provided for
    free and under the groundbreaking W3C Patent Policy. For its work
    to make online videos more accessible with captions and subtitles,
    W3C received a 2016 Emmy Award. And for its work to standardize a
    Full TV Experience on the Web, W3C received a 2019 Emmy
    Award. </p>

    <p>W3C's vision for "One Web" brings together thousands of
    dedicated technologists representing more than
    400 <a href="/Consortium/Member/List">Member organizations</a> and
    dozens of industry sectors. W3C is jointly hosted by

        <p id="oracle">Lack of interoperability standards and a highly fragmented ecosystem full of proprietary interfaces 
        have been major hurdles for enterprise adoption of IoT technologies. 
        These issue have been compounded by the wide range of proprietary data formats and connectivity protocols 
        that are used across many different industries, making it very difficult to build IoT platforms 
        that can be quickly extended for a large range of use cases. 
        At Oracle we are thrilled that W3C Web of Things is addressing these issues head-on with the W3C Web of Things Specifications. 
        Open standards have always opened up closed markets and driven rapid technology adoption. 
        We firmly believe that this IoT ecosystem and the W3C Web of Things community will play a major role
