    <p id="desc"><a href="/">https://www.w3.org/</a> &#8212; DD Month
    2020 &#8212; The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced today
    that <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">Web of
    Things (WoT) Architecture</a>
    and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">Web of Things (WoT) Thing
    Description</a> (TD) are now official W3C Recommendations.
    These complement
    existing standardized web technologies to enable easy
    integration across Internet of Things platforms and
    applications. 
    </p>
    <p>@@quote?</p>
    <p>With the diversity of technologies used in Internet of Things (IoT), such as protocols and data models, 
    information technology users are increasingly facing high integration and maintenance costs in IoT projects
    as well as the risk of vendor lock-in often leaving them stuck with obsolete software and falling behind in innovation.
  The mission of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things</a> activities is 
	    to counter the fragmentation of the Internet of Things by defining a Web-based abstraction layer for, e.g., 
	    existing platforms, devices, gateways and services. By complementing existing standards, it reduces risk for 
	    investors and customers as well as enables rapid growth of open markets for devices and services.</p>
  <p>
  Two baseline specifications have been developed since the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/02/media-advisory-wot-wg.html.en">launch</a> of the Web of Things Working Group. They define an abstract architecture and several building blocks 
  and a common data format for describing devices and services: 
  <ul>
     <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">WoT Architecture</a> describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.</li> 
     <li>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/">WoT Thing Description</a> provides a common human- and machine-readable data format for describing Thing's metadata and its capabilities including used data model, protocol and security setup.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
The WoT Thing Description is to the Internet of Things what index.html is to a website: it can be considered as the entry point of a physical or virtual Thing/device. The WoT building blocks increase interoperability for IoT applications and reduce integration efforts and costs. 
</p>

<p>
During the course of the Web of Things standardization activities, several other informative documents were also created, such as WoT Scripting API, WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines, and WoT Binding Templates.
	</p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>
        The goal of the WoT is to enhance interoperability and counter fragmentation in IoT 
        using a cross-ecosystem approach.
        In particular, rather than prescribing behavior, interfaces, or data models, the
        WoT Thing Description provide a common way for descriptive information (metadata) about 
        these key aspects of IoT devices and services to be communicated with.
        The ability to share service metadata is a key enabler
        of an open market for IoT devices and services.
    </p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>

    <p>

      The two WoT documents that have recently become W3C Recommendations 
      define the WoT Architecture and the WoT Thing Description (TD).
      The WoT Architecture document describes the overall Web of Things conceptual framework.
      Whereas the WoT Thing Description provides a standard way for the metadata 
      of a Thing to be provided, including descriptions of its network API, semantics, and data models.
      The WoT Working Group and Interest Group have also published some
      related informative documents: 
      the WoT Security and Privacy Guidelines, 
      the WoT Scripting API, and the WoT Binding Templates.
      The WoT Binding Templates describe how WoT Thing Descriptions can be used 
      with specific concrete protocols.
      The WoT Scripting API provides a common way to access and process 
      WoT Thing Descriptions from within applications as well as to interact with the Things.
    </p>

    <h3>Impact</h3>

    <p>
      The Web of Things is applicable to multiple IoT domains, including
      Smart Home, Industrial, Smart City, Retail, and Health applications.
      In general, the use of W3C WoT standards can simplify the development of IoT systems that 
      combine devices from multiple vendors and ecosystems.
      For different kinds of users, the W3C WoT standards provide the following specific benefits:
      <dl>
	      <dt>Developers</dt>
	      <dd>WoT simplifies software development and service integration.</dd>
	      <dt>Device vendors</dt>
	      <dd>WoT provides a mechanism to provide and document open APIs.</dd>
	      <dt>Cloud platform and application vendors</dt> 
	      <dd>WoT provides opportunities to provide support services and applications.</dd>
        <dt>System integrators</dt>
		<dd>WoT provides a way to build systems that 
            integrate devices across vendors and ecosystems.</dd>
		<dt>Governments and regulatory agencies building open IoT platforms</dt>
		<dd>WoT
            provides an open standard for communicating available services.</dd>
      </dl>
      Many of these use cases and applications were discussed at length
      in the recent <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/ws-2019/cfp.html">WoT Workshop</a>. 
    </p>

    <h3>What's Next?</h3>

    <p>
    The WoT WG has recently renewed its charter and will be addressing a number of 
    new enhancements, including discovery, onboarding, and  
    profile mechanism.
    See the new <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/01/wot-wg-charter.html">WoT WG Charter</a>

      <p id="conexxus">Over the past couple of years, operators in the Convenience Retail Industry have come to a 
	      realization: “data” may be a more important asset than “location.” Existing, purpose-built data 
	      streams (such as transaction logs) exclude important contextual data, and while IoT data could help fill 
	      this gap, operators face big integration challenges in the absence of standards. The lack of standards for 
	      defining IoT data also makes it difficult for operators to propose definitions tailored to their needs. Web of Things 
	      promises to solve both the integration and the definition problems for retail operators. Conexxus, as the standards 
	      organization for Convenience Retail, endorses the Web of Things work and has already begun to use “Thing Descriptions” in 
	      current committees. Thanks to W3C for supporting this forward-looking work.</p>

		‘Web of Things Architecture’ and ‘Web of Things Thing Description’ by W3C. The Internet has been taking 
		on a role to connect people to people with organizations through Web Technology. Accordingly, due to the spread of 
		the IoT Technology, the Web Technology has found itself a new role of connecting various things to the Internet. It means, 
		people, things and organization can now freely exchange information and data through the Web Technology. Furthermore, as 
		5G services spread, it is easy to imagine the combination of IoT Technology and Web Technology can lead us towards a 
		prosperous future.</p>
	    <p>
		    In fact, there are various protocols for IoT Technology exists today in the world, but unfortunately the interoperability 
		    of information and data exchange in between people and things, organization and things, things and things, are not 
		    being realized. In this situation, we are certain that ‘Web of Things Architecture’ and 
		    ‘Web of Things Thing Description’ will become the solution for this matter.

        <p id="oracle">Lack of interoperability standards and a highly fragmented ecosystem full of proprietary interfaces 
        have been major hurdles for enterprise adoption of IoT technologies. 
        These issue have been compounded by the wide range of proprietary data formats and connectivity protocols 
        that are used across many different industries, making it very difficult to build IoT platforms 
        that can be quickly extended for a large range of use cases. 
        At Oracle we are thrilled that W3C Web of Things is addressing these issues head-on with the W3C Web of Things Specifications. 
        Open standards have always opened up closed markets and driven rapid technology adoption. 
        We firmly believe that this IoT ecosystem and the W3C Web of Things community will play a major role 
        in bringing IoT technologies mainstream, and become a catalyst for a number of innovations benefitting a wide range of industries.</p>
